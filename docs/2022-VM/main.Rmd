# Notes

The template and css makes a presentation that has a few tweaks in `slides-style.css`.  `slide-style.css` is adapted from An RStudio workshop on data science [design-ds-classroom](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/design-ds-classroom) by [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel). 

* I have tweaked the title slide css in `slides-style.css` and needed to remove `date:` from the yaml.
* `slides-style.css` has a number of extra customizations such as square for the bullets, some colored boxes, and a wide left column class.
* Instead of page numbers, there is a progress bar across the top.
* You may want to futz with the css for the title at the top of `slides-style.css`
* To add a Table of Contents, I wrote a helper function `render_toc.R` and add `name:` and `text:` to each slide. `name` should have no spaces. `text` is what you want to show for the TOC. If you leave off `text:`, it will use `name`. If you leave off `name`, the slide won't appear int he TOC.
* I am using `https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra` to have the tile navigation.

* Basic introduction to "containers", environments and virtual machines (VM)
* Binder
* VMs on AWS
* GitHub Codespaces

# Disclaimers

.yellowbox[

## Do not put sensitive, confidential, or otherwise private data onto machines in the cloud.

## Everything I show is free but you should put billing limits on any platform (e.g. AWS) that could be used to rack up computing charges.

## In a 'Gold Standard' application one would probably will use a commercial distribution of Docker or Kubernetes in order to simplify deployment and obtain professional support services.

# Footnotes

Because the NMFS footnote is already occupying the footnote space, you need to add some linefeeds to move the footnote upward. 



- some content
- a [link](http://www.google.com)


```{r}
r <- 2 + 2
```

.footnote[It is quite finicky. Add a linefeed and it breaks.<br><br>]
